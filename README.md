## kedtechLa workflow for fm-gai-lottie-true-false-v1

1. Open a new terminal in the root directory.
2. Run the command `python app.py`. This will run the web application locally.
3. Update the `input.json` file with a suitable object from the kedtechLa playground.
4. Open the application in the chrome browser `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
5. Run `/build` to create a new activity object. Observe terminal output for status updates.
6. After the build process is completed, run `/` to refresh the browser session.
7. After testing the object with Ss, if it is useful, add it to the `data.json` file.
